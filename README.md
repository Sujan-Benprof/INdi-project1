My journey on doing this Project:-

In this 2 weeks of time, I did my project making blog on some particular topic and  i choosed some informational blog about coding. 
This is my first ever project, which made me some diffiuclt to complete it. I had to watch saome videos on youtube for the ideas, looked over some popular blogs and also looked in chatgpt for some coding to learn and ways to put elemnets on my project. While doing this project, i had to do some research for my topic, and i did the researches. At the beggining, i felt kind of didfficult to do research, even felt difficult to complete this project, but watching videos and getting ideas from various websites , i completed it.

It was a little step towards my IT career, and i enjoyed my this tiny project. its really a tiny one, but i couldnot make it as better as i was hoping for..
